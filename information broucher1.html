        The National Highway No.6 and State highways SH-6, SH-184 and SH-186 pass though Jalgaon City
        and hence the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Public Works Department (PWD)
        Government of Maharashtra are responsible for the provision and maintenance of roads within
        Jalgaon City along with the Jalgaon City Municipal Corporation (JCMC). The Road Structure in Jalgaon
        City does not reveal that of a planned system. Hierarchies between major and minor roads have not
        been maintained in terms of ‘Rings and Radials’ and a consistent pattern of connectivity between
        arterials and sub arterials need to be achieved.<br>
        i) Road Infrastructure: The available road length in Jalgaon city is 430 km (this includes the National
        and State Highways within the city area) and the road density is 1.16 meter per person. The types of
        roads cover the whole spectrum from unsurfaced (WBM) to bitumen surfaced and cement concrete
        category. There is a variation in the degree of usage of different roads within the city. Roads such as
        the ones in the Gaothan area (small lanes and by lanes) are today the least frequently used and fallinto the
        category of least maintained roads in the city. The average speed on the roads is between
        15 – 30 kmph and falls into the safe zone as of today. Majority of the delays are caused at
        interchanges/ junctions that require improvement.<br>
        Modal Spilt: The comparison of various modes of trip making as shown in figure 1 clearly indicates
        the present preference of the city for non
        inhabitants still prefer the pedestrian mode.
        An assessment of the quality of city roads revealed that the effective road widths are reduced due to
        encroachments, absence of pedestrian sidewalks and haphazard parking, which have implications on
        optimum speed and desirable safety standards.
        The need to tackle present problems
        maintenance free roads. A land use analysis of the roads indicated that 54% of roads are abutted by
        commercial areas; 29% cater to residential establishments and the remaining 17% are spread alon
        industrial and recreational centre
        – motorized means of travels; primarily the city inhabitants still prefer the pedestrian mode.

Operation and Management Issues:- Encroachment by hawkers and unauthorized parking has
reduced the effective road widths available and this problem is prevalent especially in the Central
Business Areas such as Navipeth etc. Though the road surface available is fairly good, much needs
to be done to improve the riding quality of the city roads. Pedestrian footpaths are non existent in
most parts of the city and need to be introduced to avoid mixing of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
Roads have faulty alignments, absence of cross drainage works and railway overbridges, and lack
of road markings. Majority of the delays on roads are caused at interchanges/ junctions which
require improvement; City Development Plan-UIDSSMT City Municipal Corporation of Jalgaon .
Most of the roads are of the two lanes undivided type and pose potential safety hazards. Lack of
planned and designated bus stops/bays, particularly in the city results in interrupted traffic flow and
leads to accidents. The city does not have proper drainage system along the roads to run-off
rainwater.

    Below is a news regarding remaining work of Jalgaon-Aurangabad road:<br>
The work of widening the Aurangabad-Ajanta-Jalgaon highway in Maharashtra, which has got
affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting manpower crunch, is likely to get over by
the end of this year, an official said . The coronavirus situation led to the delay in the work and
getting clearances from various government agencies, he said. The delay in the work of converting
the 150-km long highway into a four-lane road has impacted the tourist footfall at the world heritage
site of Ajanta. Earlier, there was an issue about contractors, then the coronavirus-induced lockdown
and then the restrictions delayed this four-laning work," the official said. Superintendent Engineer of
PWD (national highway) Prashant Auti said, "We have completed the work of 110-km long stretch of
the road so far and the work of 20 km long road would be carried out without any hurdle." "We are
facing some problems with 20-km long road as there are some land-related issues. The revenue
officials are deployed for the coronavirus duty, which is why it is a little pending," he added. The
Aurangabad Municipal Corporation should help us in removing encroachments in the project area,
he said. "We can complete the road widening work by November this year," he said, adding that the
time needed to cover the distance of 150-km road would take at least 180 minutes, which will now
be curtailed by nearly 130 minutes once the project is complete.
